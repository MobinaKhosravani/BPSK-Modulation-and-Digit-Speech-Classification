## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to classify spoken digits (0–9) from audio recordings. The workflow involves **dataset generation**, **feature extraction**, **training a classifier**, and **testing/predicting** new audio samples.

### Dataset Generation (Python)
Two Python scripts are used to create the labeled dataset:
1. **`say_numbers_prompt.py`** – Prompts the user to say numbers in a randomized sequence and controls timing for recording in Audacity.
2. **`split_and_label_numbers.py`** – Splits the recorded WAV file into individual digit audio files, trims silence, and labels them into the `recordings` folder.  

This ensures a structured dataset for training and testing the classification model.

### `Project.m`
The main MATLAB script for **digit classification**. Steps:
1. Loads all labeled audio files and converts stereo to mono.
2. Extracts audio features including **MFCC, STFT, FFT, spectral features, and temporal features**.
3. Splits the dataset into **training (80%)** and **testing (20%)** sets.
4. Trains a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier.
5. Evaluates performance using accuracy and a **confusion matrix**.
6. Predicts digits from new audio files or sequences, including those generated by `Generate_sequence.m`.

### `Generate_sequence.m`
Generates **random sequences of digits** from the dataset and saves them as WAV files. These sequences simulate real-world spoken digit input for testing the classifier.

## Key Features
- Multi-feature extraction capturing **frequency, temporal, and perceptual characteristics** of audio.
- **SVM classifier** for high accuracy (93–95% on test data).
- Predicts both **single digits** and **digit sequences**.
- Python scripts automate **dataset preparation** from raw recordings.

## Usage
1. Record your digits using Audacity at 8000 Hz and export as a single WAV file.
2. Run `split_and_label_numbers.py` to create labeled recordings.
3. Optionally, generate digit sequences with `Generate_sequence.m`.
4. Open MATLAB and run `Project.m` to train the classifier and predict digits.
